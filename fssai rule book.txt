SECTION D: How NutriLabel AI should use this file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Compliance engine should treat this as a screening checklist, not certification.
2) If risk signals are high (for example excessive sugar/saturated fat/sodium per serving), show warnings.
3) Always display:
   - "Educational checker, not legal certification."
   - "Final legal compliance requires complete label review against latest official regulations."
4) Keep links to official references visible in UI/README so users can verify.
